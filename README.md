# cmml

Simple utilities for Python machine learning - things you often need to do, are easy to write, but still annoying.


## Usage in Google Colab


There is probably a better way than to copy the data all the time, but this

```none
!rm -r cmml
!git clone -q https://github.com/JaquenHgar/cmml.git
!pip install -q cmml/
```

```python
import cmml.plotting as cplot
```
